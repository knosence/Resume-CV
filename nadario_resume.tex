        {}{Java (Spring, Groovy, TTD, XP, H2)}
          \indent This CLI based Application creates a store that functions as a service that reponds to the customer request to buy goods, automaticlly restocks products by sending a request for prices on those items to three different vendors, compares them and sends a request to the vender with the best price to make a purchase, and monitors profits. This project served as a training ground for understanding how microservices worked during the DigitalCrafts training.

          \indent Our team was tasked with creating an Web Application that would help with warehouses keep track of shipments through specialized numbers. This tracking system would show the status of the shipment as being loaded, en route, unloaded, and received. It also displayed loading dock status and information, letting the driver know where the warehouse expects him to park. The Application also shows more detailed information of the shipment itself, by displaying the items being shipped, and can be used as a way to check off what, on the delivery, has been received, en route, are bring loaded. Docks are also customizable and can be added or removed by admin-level users.
